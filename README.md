This is a simple example of **how to design C# interface model** for the basic RPG using Unity3D gameobjects.
This code is **not meant to be functional**, but designed to show how to make a somewhat expandable system using C# classes interfaces.
Unity objects will not contain any scripts, **all the logics is driven by C# classes**, containing Unity3D gameobjects, that are used for physics simulation and rendering.
